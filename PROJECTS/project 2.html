        The Prius’ 1.8L Inline-4 hybrid powertrain fails to deliver a thrilling acceleration. The combination of the aspirated
        4-cylinder and electric motor only managed an output of 121 horsepower. Toyota wasn’t too keen on disclosing the Prius’ 
        0-60 stat, but according to independent tests, the car would take 10.5 seconds to reach 60 mph – not great. The Prius isn’t
        your best bet if you’re looking for something more energetic.
        Cramped Rear Seats.
        While we’re not expecting the Prius to sit five professional NBA players at the back comfortably, even normal-sized adults
        will find the rear seats cramped. The 33.4 inches of legroom may be enough for kids and teens, but full-grown adults will 
        not likely have a relaxing time. This drawback will only matter if you regularly have back seat passengers; otherwise, it’s
        the biggest issue with the Prius..

    <p>With the volatility of fuel prices, consumers are currently subjected to ever-increasing fuel
         costs with no end in sight. Investing in a hybrid vehicle like the Prius provides a massive 
         relief at the pump. True enough, if the Prius excels at anything, it’s fuel economy – and
          Toyota always seems to find a way to improve in this area.

        The current 2022 Toyota Prius has gas mileage ratings of 58/53/56 (city/highway/combined)
         mpg for the base model, which is also the most economical. With an 11.3-gallon tank, the
          base Prius can drive up to a whopping 633 miles with a full tank. The other FWD models 
          and the AWD configuration are slightly less efficient but still offer excellent fuel economy..</p>

    <h1>2 fiat multipla</h1>

    <p>
        According to the Euro NCAP, a safety rating agency like the NHTSA, the Fiat Multipla scores three out of five stars for safety.
        That doesn’t sound bad, but it’s not great. It scored well for side impact safety, but its frontal impact scores really wrecked
        its rating.
        Motors U.K. also reports that the Fiat Multipla is unreliable. It has a tendency to require frequent repairs, which is something
        that will continually get worse as the car ages. While mechanically sound, it seems like the Multipla’s low-quality materials
        and craft extend to trim and hardware as well as mechanical parts. There’s an old joke that Fiat stands for “Fix it again,
        Tony,” and whoever invented that joke probably owned a Multipla at one time. 
        Like today’s crossovers and minivans, the Fiat Multipla is a true multi-purpose vehicle (MPV). Need space for five to six people
        and their luggage? The Multipla has it covered. Want to haul boxes or move furniture? Just remove the seats, and the Multipla
        offers a surprising amount of room. What about a small, practical, and economical car? Unlike a minivan or crossover, the
        Multipla has that covered too.

        Getting in and out is easy, courtesy of high, wide doors and seats that are comfortably but not excessively high.
        All six seats are identical and equally comfortable, all have three-point seatbelts and all are light (16kg) 
        and easily removable. The middle seat up front can be folded flat (to give three extra cupholders) or replaced
        completely by a console including an 18-litre cooled or heated box. It's the same in the rear, where the middle
        seat can be either folded or removed to accommodate a small fridge. Rear seat leg and headroom is outstanding
        for such a small car - almost limousine-like in the rearmost of the two mounting positions on offer. Even with
        the seats set this far back, there's still as much luggage space (430 litres) behind them as you'd find in a
        Mercedes C-Class, or 540 litres if you click them forward a notch (sacrificing little in terms of passenger comfort).
        This is, in other words, one of the few mini-MPVs you can buy with a decent amount of luggage space - as much as 1,300
        litres if you treat the Multipla as a three-seater.

        I'm fascinated by the concept of driving around on pure electricity, and I'd love to see the technology eventually work
        as a real-world alternative to internal combustion.
        But beyond the issues of cost and range there remains perhaps the biggest challenge that won't be easily solved — charge time.
        When I drove our long-term Nissan Leaf home a few weeks ago the range went from 95 to 24 miles.
        That wasn't so troubling, but I did drain over 75% of the battery and I don't have a 240V charger at my house. When I saw the charge
        time for my 110V home outlet I realized I couldn't leave the house until lunch the following day (I was plugging in around 6 p.m.)
        if I wanted the Leaf fully charged before driving it again.
        That's a loooooong time for a fill-up, and one that the majority of new car buyers couldn't deal with on any regular basis.
        One solution is to have pre-charged batteries at corner locations, just like gas stations. You drive in, swap batteries and
        drive away taking no more time than a current gasoline fill-up takes. Let's see if we can make that work.

           At once the Leaf is both soothing and stressful. Climb in, press the start button, and besides the dashboard lighting up to the
            accompaniment of a few bongs, you’d never know it was running. After any other car, the complete lack of vibrations is wonderful,
            so you glide along in relaxed comfort. You’re a little more aware of wind and suspension noise without a cacophony of explosions
            under the bonnet masking their sounds, but overall the Leaf is wonderfully refined. Good ride comfort too, comfy seats as well,
            inviting cabin at night, and your world is calm by the time you arrive home.
            But while the actual driving experience is utterly relaxing, everything either side of actually being behind the wheel is more
            stressful than in a car with an engine. There’s the cable that needs to be unplugged and coiled into the boot before setting
            off – it feels like the 21st century equivalent of hand cranking your car. And it’s invariably wet, and drags leaves with it,
            so you dump it in the boot (rather than putting it into the special pouch) which keeps your hands cleaner but gets your boot
            dirtier.

        <p>
            We won't go out on a limb and necessarily describe the concept car as a visual success, but the production Aztek was born into
            this world looking, well, a lot worse than the show property. When it arrived for the 2001 model year, the Aztek had gained
            goofy plastic body cladding. It also lacked the concept's admittedly better, wider stance, and thus appeared tall and narrow,
            with too-small wheels. The Aztek's unveiling was as strange as the vehicle itself, as the brand manager for the Aztek jumped
            into a mosh pit during the press conference, which also featured a fake counterculture crowd holding up protest-style signs
            (just look at the image below). Theatrics aside, the final design wasn't nearly as well received as the concept.
            The Aztek taught us compromise doesn't always work and design matters, and both are lessons automakers should remember as the
            active-lifestyle trend continues unabated. While the Pontiac checked every box for the nascent crossover-SUV market, it was
            somehow worse than the sum of its parts.

        <p>
            Performance-wise, the Aztek wasn't bad. A 185-hp 3.4-liter V-6seemed powerful enough at the time. So equipped, the Aztek could
            run from zero to 60 mph in 9.2 seconds, making it quicker than the Mitsubishi Montero Sport and Jeep Cherokee Sport and on pace
            with the Isuzu Rodeo SUV. Unfortunately, the Aztek left us wanting when it came to engine and transmission refinement as well
            as rear visibility.MotorTrend's long-term Aztektest vehicle suffered some electrical gremlins, too.
            The 2002 model removed much of the hideous body cladding (those pieces went body color), and later, you could get a DVD entertainment
            system and even a Rally Edition with a lowered ride and a bigger rear spoiler—although standing out even more wasn't exactly what
            the model needed. Production ended in 2005.

        To fully appreciate these talents, though, you first have to appreciate the Cube's unusual character. Such boxy and quirky cars
        are all the rage in Japan. However, the Cube is so boxy and so quirky that it almost seems like a Japanese caricature -- the car
        equivalent of a ninja dressed in Hello Kitty pajamas riding on the back of a robot Godzilla.

    At its core, the Cube is a compact hatchback with a low price, a generous amount of passenger space and a fuel-efficient engine.
    Yet there are obviously folks who find the 2011 Nissan Cube's unique style and array of features appealing. For them (and perhaps you),
    it's important to note that beneath the boxy exterior is the same platform that underpins the Nissan Versa, a comfortable but somewhat
    dull subcompact. Along with the Cube's water-like rippling texture in the headliner and dashboard that looks like the cabin of a Chev
    cargo van viewed through a funhouse mirror, the Cube provides plenty of passenger space and amenities for the price. Of particular
    note is the backseat that both reclines and slides, which is a unique feature for this class.

        I like a man who gets straight to the point. The Tribeca’s certainly an acquired taste – it’s difficult to look at either end without
        wanting to vomit. But at least it’s distinctive, and viewed in profile it’s actually fairly handsome. But yes, this does look like a
        car that’s got some chromosomal abnormalities going on.
        It’s hoping to steer you away from established premium SUVs like BMW’s X3 and into the hands of your Subaru dealer. The press material
        even mentions the X5 as a rival and in fact the Tribeca is longer then the outgoing X5. But the B9’s lack of badge and polish make it
        difficult to believe that anyone would opt out of the BMW, and that’s before you’ve turned a wheel.

        Rivalling cars like the Nissan Murano and Lexus RX, the Subaru Tribeca uses the same 3.0-litre six-cylinder ‘boxer’ engine as found
        in the Legacy linked to a five-speed automatic transmission. It has permanent four-wheel drive, but has been designed for on-road
        use rather than driving off road. In fact Subaru’s own Legacy Outback model is more of an off-road vehicle than the Tribeca.
        The plush looking interior has soothing, flowing lines, but the exterior styling jars, with heavy-handed details at the front and a
        fussy tailgate area which makes the car look larger than it is. The vague steering lets it down on the road and it lacks the driver
        appeal you’d expect given Subaru’s reputation for keen handling cars.

            Nissan Jukes are popular family cars, but they’re less practical and boxy than the Qashqai, being based on the smaller Micra.
            Look at the boot trim, bumper, rear seats and the door trim and sounding seals for damage and scratches, particularly the back
            of the front passenger seat for rips or tears caused by cramming the tip run or an IKEA excursion’s bounty aboard.
            1.5-litre diesel engine
            This is the most common Juke you will find, and it’s not a bad buy. Look for frequent services and listen for dry/squeaking bearing
            sounds near the belts. The timing belt should be changed at five years or 72,000 miles, but some have failed before that interval
            and owners recommend four years or 50,000 miles.
            Fuel leaks are not uncommon, usually around the return line, so any smell of diesel should be investigated. It’s not a quick car,
            but if a Juke 1.5 diesel feels slower than similar cars you’ve driven it could have problems with the turbo or the diesel particulate
            filter.

            The funky-looking Juke is a quasi-SUV derived from the subcompact Nissan Versa. It's got the raised ride height and optional all-wheel
            drive of an SUV, but the steeply raked rear quarter of a hatchback. Our testers all enjoyed driving it, but had some doubts about its
            usefulness, largely because of the very tight rear seats and trifling cargo space behind them. Nimble handling and a punchy turbocharged
            powertrain make it fun and agile. Fuel economy isn't bad for an all-wheel-drive vehicle, but the need for premium fuel is a downer.

        Now that we’ve discussed the primary points of concern on the 2020 Kia Telluride, let’s take a moment to briefly go over the main
        problems and what they mean to you.
        2002 Ford Taurus: Faulty Transmission
        2003 Ford Taurus: Faulty Transmission
        2005 Ford Taurus: Faulty Transmission
        Bad transmission plagued the Ford Taurus during these three different years. And given the expensive price tag to fix transmission
        problems, the investment simply isn’t worth the risk.
        If you find a used Taurus during any of these three years, it’s safe to assume that transmission problems are incoming if they aren’t
        already present. This is especially true if the vehicle has higher mileage, which is most probable.
        So when it comes to investing in a used sedan, you now know which Ford Taurus years to avoid. The sheer volume of complaints from both
        consumers and the NHTSA outweighs any reason to invest. Moreover, the cost to repair transmission failure pretty much seals the deal.
        The good news is that if you’re set on buying a Ford Taurus, there are many other years that don’t present this concern. Stick to later
        models or anything before 1997 to avoid transmission issues.
        As long as the previous owner took good care of the vehicle, you might be able to find a cherry Taurus from the car’s earlier years
        of production.

        The '96-'99 Taurus came in four trim levels: G, GL, LX, and topline SE. Available in four-door sedan and four-door wagon configurations,
        it offered two V-6 engines when first launched. Standard was the venerable 3.0L/145-hp overhead-valve Vulcan V-6, an adequate, durable,
        though hardly exciting powerplant. Next up was the Duratec DOHC 3.0L/200-hp V-6, which injected a bit of fun into the equation.
        In late1996, the high-revving, limited-edition SHO (Super High Output, pictured) model entered the lineup with a 235-hp Ford/Yamaha
        V-8 mated to an automatic transmission, plus a sportier suspension, larger brakes, special ZF steering, and more.

        Styling? Always in the eye of the beholder, but our staff was split. We liked the overall shapes, especially in profile,
        but the detailing is fussy. The rear spoiler looks like too long an afterthought; the frontal aspect is confused; and we're
        not sure the fender "eyebrows" were worth copying from that mid-'70s Monte (popularized in an era notable for disco and the
        leisure suit). Chevrolet hopes you'll like it, but also hopes it appeals to the windaas in the wind that will blow across 
        its flanks while running NASCAR tracks such as Daytona and Talladega. You see, Monte Carlo is NASCAR's winningest nameplate.

        an eye toward keeping that winning streak intact.

        Totally redesigned for 2000, Chevrolet's midsize sports coupe switched from the Lumina platform to that of the new, larger Impala
        sedan. Eye-catching styling stood out from any other domestic model, and even featured some design cues from the original Monte
        Carlos of the 1970s. Two inches shorter overall than the previous Monte, it was three inches longer in wheelbase, giving passengers
        an extra inch of leg room. A 180-horsepower 3.4-liter V6 went into the LS coupe, while the sporty SS got a 200-bhp 3.8-liter V6,
        along with firmer suspension settings and standard alloy wheels. Each engine drove a four-speed automatic transmission.
        Both versions had all-disc antilock braking, but side-impact airbags were not available. Front bucket seats made for
        five-passenger capacity. Leather upholstery and GM's OnStar emergency/communications were optional for both the LS and SS.
        Standard equipment included air conditioning, power windows, a rear defroster, tilt steering column, and tire-inflation monitor.
        SS coupes added traction control, a rear spoiler, dual-zone climate control, remote keyless entry, and fog lamps.

        Avoiding the 2012, 2013, and 2014 model years is generally recommended. The 2012 model, in particular, faced multiple recalls
        related to airbag deployment issues and brake vacuum pump failures. The 2013 and 2014 models, while having fewer documented
        issues, may have deteriorated battery capacity due to their age and received mixed user reviews.

        The 2016 and 2017 model years are considered the most reliable options for the i-MiEV. These later models have fewer reported issues
        and benefit from improvements made over the earlier versions. The 2017 model, being the final year before discontinuation, is often
        regarded as the most refined and reliable of the lineup.

            Beauty, they say, is in the eye of the beholder. However, over the years, some cars have proven so visually challenging that few
            would argue they’re anything other than ugly. Whether the designer was trying hard to stand out or clung on to a styling concept
            that just didn’t work away from a sheet of paper, the result is usually the same - looks only a manufacturer could love.
